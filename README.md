# Flowers Classification

This is a small project for classification of different types of flowers pictures. Here I use a standart CNN with data augmentation for better accuracy and to avoid overfitting. This model is provided in '*Flowers classification CNN (+data augmentation)*' file.

The second file '*Flowers classification CNN (TL)*' resolves the same issue, but in a different way. Here I use **Transfer Learning**, which allows to reach better results faster. 

First models was trained during 10 epochs and reached the level of ~65% of accuracy, while pretrained model needed just 5 epochs and gave me ~87% of accuracy.
